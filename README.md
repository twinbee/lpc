# Large Pinball Collider: an impossible Pinball table

This is a particle-accelerator based pinball table which came to me in a dream on Jan 31, 2016. Because of the complexity, it is probably impossible to physically build, so a software implementation will have to suffice.

## Table features


__Particle acceleration (magnetic spinner)__

In the center of the table is the Particle Accelerator, a magnetic spinner. The spinner will accelerate the ball in a grazing fashion similar to the way a partial orbit around a planet accelerates a spacecraft. This is similar to the magnetic features in Whirlwind or Adams Family, or Fun House.

__Fundamental interaction (kicker array)__

The buttons on the qwerty keyboard will be mapped to massive arrays of kickers within the play field. These kickers will be given symbols like mu, tau, e-. The arrays will be themed with all leptons together, all bosons, and all quarks.

__Gun Malfunction (Massive multi-ball)__

A large number of particles (balls) enter the table and many of the scoring bumpers temporarily turn into gutters. In this mode, the Fundamental Interaction kicker arrays can be used to try to get a Higgs. Gun Malfunction can be triggered or a random event.

__Quantum Entablement__

A particle (ball) may be captured on either the left or right side of the table. When a ball is captured on the opposite pocket of the table, they become a quantum-entabled pair. When either ball experiences an accelerating force, the entabled ball experiences a force of the same magnitude in exactly the opposite direction.


__Finding the Higgs (Scoring)__

The player discovers the Higgs Boson by hitting a locked pocket near the top of the play field. The energy level needed to find the Higgs opens up only occassionally. Score-boarding will be based on finding the Higgs boson. The Higgs Energy (pocket) is opened up only once a certain base score has been reached (every 100000 base-points), and will close after 30 seconds of play time.
